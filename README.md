### makeIGV-link

Simple script that can make special URL links encoding your data into URL, such as BAM
files, so that you can visualise it in [Intergrative Genomics Viewer](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) or
IGV for short. Here is [IGV's guide](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/ControlIGV) on 'special IGV URLs'.
IGV is pretty cool in that it's enable your to launch and use it without needing to install it on your local
machine. Sometimes you do need to install some JAVA dependencies on your local machine to be able to run IGV
over internet. Here is a link on how to start [IGV with web start](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/startingIGV).

`git clone https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/PieScripts.git`

### makeDallaince 

[BioDalliance](http://www.biodalliance.org/) is this awesome _browser_ to view genomic data. It is a self
contained JavaScript object that you can embed into web page. Major advantage of BioDalliance is it's truly
platform independed and you can run it from any device that supports web browser. This is the future and totally
different way to interact with your data. You can view your data on the smart phone or a table or desktop. With
everything being in the _cloud_ these days you don't want to limit yourself to desktop only applications.
